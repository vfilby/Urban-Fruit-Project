  %dt How do I save plant locations?
  %dd For starters you need to create a user account.  After that the hardest part is ensuring you have the location correct.  There are a two ways to track the location: 1) you can enter a latitude/longitude directly, or 2) you can drag a pin on the map to set the location.  Mobile apps like Evernote automatically save a lat/long with each note, so you can use that to track lat/longs for plants in the wild.
